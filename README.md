<section id="install">

## Installation

<br />

On macOS, all one has to do is clone this repo into the VS Code `extensions` directory.

Hold <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd> to open the command palette, then type <kbd>C</kbd>
and select "Color Themes", and it should show up.

On both macOS and Windows, this `extensions` directory is located in the hidden `.vscode` folder
in the user's home directory:

```console
~/.vscode/extensions
```

On Windows, the theme will not show up in the "Color Themes" drop-down until it has been both:
cloned into the `extensions` directory _and_ installed via the command palette option of:
"Developer: Install Extensions from Location" and then had its folder selected.

**Enjoy!**

## Backstory

<br />

<!-- <small>This is the README for VS Code extension: "infuse-js-dark".</small> -->

The Infuse.js Dark syntax theme was originally inspired by the [Blackboard][]; color scheme
however, a significant amount of modifications have been made to it. Among those modifications
include representing the color palette now expressed in an entirely new format.
