<br />

The Infuse.js Dark syntax theme was originally inspired by the [Blackboard][] color scheme;
however, a significant amount of modifications have been made to it. Among those modifications
include representing the color palette in an entirely new format.

Thanks!

<section id="install">

## Installation

<br />

On macOS, all one has to do is clone this repo into the VS Code `extensions` directory.

Hold <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></kbd> to open the command palette, then type <kbd>C</kbd>
and select &ldquo;Color Themes&rdquo;, and it should show up.

On both macOS and Windows, this `extensions` directory is located in the hidden `.vscode` folder
in the user home directory:

```console
~/.vscode/extensions
```

On Windows, the theme will not show up in the &ldquo;Color Themes&rdquo; drop-down until it has been both:
cloned into the hidden user `extensions` directory _and_ installed via the command palette and selecting
&ldquo;Developer: Install Extensions from Location&rdquo; and had its folder correctly selected.

**_[Enjoy!][spoiler-screen-cap]_**
